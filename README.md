Description: A website in which you can add your Favorite books and keep track of whether you read it or not.

link to the website: https://prithvirajkawade.github.io/MyBookLibrary/

Difficulties:

1. The first problem was how to prevent form submission after clicking the submit button as you lose all the data
2. The main problem was validating the user input and make sure input is not empty
3. How to dynamically create rows and add buttons to them at the same point

What I Learned from this Project:

1. How to prevent a form from submitting
2. How to validate user input without the required property of form, this was done with the help of using checkValidity function
3. How to add eventlistener to each dynamically created buttons

Features to implement in the future:

1. Add in a function which keeps track of how many books are not read and how many are already read
2. Add animations and improve the UI of the website
